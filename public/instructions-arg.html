<p>You will be given a short passage that presents an arguement, and you will also be given specific instructions on how to respond to that passage. Standard timing for this task is 30 minutes. In that time you should plan and compose a response in which you evaluate the argument passage. A response to any other argument will receive a score of zero. Make sure that you respond according to the specific instructions and support your evaluation with relevant reasons and/or examples.<br>
Note that you are NOT being asked to present your own views on the subject.<br>

Your response will be evaluated according to how well you:<br>
<ul>
<li>Respond to the specific task instructions.</li>
<li>Identify and analyze features of the argument relevant to the assigned task.</li>
<li>Organize, develop and express your analysis.</li>
<li>Support your position with relevant reasons and/or examples.</li>
<li>Control the elements of standard written English.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Before you begin writing, you may want to think for a few minutes about the argument passage and the specific task instructions and then plan your response. Be sure to develop your position fully and organize it coherently, but leave time to re-read what you have written and make any revisions you think are necessary.

<br>Click continue to proceed. Timing for the task will start when you do so.</p>
